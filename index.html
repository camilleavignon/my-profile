			Hello, I'm Camille!

		<p>
			I am a first-year student at <a href="https://www.essec.edu/fr/programme/global-bba/bba-concours/" target="_blank">ESSEC Global BBA</a>. I am actively looking for a <strong> 3-month internship </strong> (May-August) in a marketing/sales team. 
		</p>
		<p>
			I would be happy to bring my creativity, my curiosity, my sense of detail and aesthetics in addition to my first knowledge in marketing. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Fluent in English (<a href="https://www.ielts.org/about-ielts/what-is-ielts" target="_blank">IELTS</a>: 7), I would be able to interact within international teams.

		<h2>
			Cosmetics.
		</h2>
		<p>
			I've been paying attention to the cosmetics sector for several years now, and I've seen its markets transform more and more rapidly (E-commerce, V-commerce, omnichannel distribution, multiplication of niche brands, "clean" active ingredients, etc.).
		</p>
		<p>
			In light of my readings, meetings and first internships, it seems to me that the current marketing concerns of the beauty market are of three levels:
			<p>
			‣ the customer experience especially in the context of the digital revolution and thus the adaptation to the Covid pandemic ;
			</p>
			<p>
			‣ the impact of cosmetic products on both the environment and consumer health;
			</p>
			<p>
			‣ the evolution of beauty criteria and standards, the "embrace your difference" mentality with genderlessness, the LGBTQ+ community, bodypositivism, ...
			</p>
		</p>

		<h2>
			Marketing.
		</h2>
		<p>
			I am also very interested in Marketing. 
		<p>
			I was able to discover the marketing and communication jobs when I chose to be part of the <a href="https://www.entreprendre-pour-apprendre.fr/mini-entreprise/parcours-mini-l" target="_blank">"mini-company"</a> project in my high school.
		</p>
		<p>
			Following this experience, I chose to attend a business school to learn the profession and possibly end up specializing in marketing.

			On a personal note, I enjoy music very much.
		</p>
		<p>
			I have been dancing for many years and I play several instruments (piano and ukulele).
		</p> 
		<p>
			I also did a few years of theater. I also like photography and cinema.
