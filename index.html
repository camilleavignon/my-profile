			Hello, I'm Camille!
		</h1>
		<img src="profile.JPG" alt="Camille Avignon" height="200px" id="photo_profil"> 
		<p>
			I am a first-year student at ESSEC Global BBA. I am actively looking for a <strong> 3-month internship </strong> (May-August) in a marketing/sales team. 
		</p>
		<p>
			I would be happy to bring my creativity, my curiosity, my sense of detail and aesthetics in addition to my first knowledge in marketing. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Fluent in English (IELTS: 7), I would be able to interact within international teams.

		<h2>
			Cosmetics.
		</h2>
		<p>
			I've been paying attention to the cosmetics sector for several years now, and I've seen its markets transform more and more rapidly (E-commerce, V-commerce, omnichannel distribution, multiplication of niche brands, "clean" active ingredients, etc.).
		</p>
		<p>
			In light of my readings, meetings and first internships, it seems to me that the current marketing concerns of the beauty market are of three levels:
			<p>
			‣ the customer experience especially in the context of the digital revolution and thus the adaptation to the Covid pandemic ;
			</p>
			<p>
			‣ the impact of cosmetic products on both the environment and consumer health;
			</p>
			<p>
			‣ the evolution of beauty criteria and standards, the "embrace your difference" mentality with genderlessness, the LGBTQ+ community, bodypositivism, ...
			</p>
		</p>

		<h2>
			Marketing.
		</h2>
		<p>
			I am also very interested in Marketing. 
		<p>
			I was able to discover the marketing and communication jobs when I chose to be part of the " mini-company " project in my high school.
		</p>
		<p>
			Following this experience, I chose to attend a business school to learn the profession and possibly end up specializing in marketing.

		<h2>
			Hobbies.
		</h2>
		<p>
			On a personal note, I enjoy music very much.
		</p>
		<p>
			I have been dancing for many years and I play several instruments (piano and ukulele).
		</p> 
		<p>
			I also did a few years of theater. I also like photography and cinema.
