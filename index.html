			Hello, I'm Camille!
		</h1>
		<img src="profile.JPG" alt="Camille Avignon" height="230px" id="photo_profil"> 
		<p>
			I am a first-year student at <a href="https://www.essec.edu/fr/programme/global-bba/bba-concours/" target="_blank">ESSEC Global BBA</a>. 
			<br>
			I am actively looking for a <strong> 3-month internship </strong> (May-August) in a <strong> marketing/sales team</strong>. 
			<br>
			I would be happy to bring my creativity, my curiosity, my sense of detail and aesthetics in addition to my first knowledge in marketing. 
			<br>
			Fluent in English, I would be able to interact within international teams.

		<h2>
			Cosmetics.
		</h2>
		<p>
			I've been paying attention to the cosmetics sector for several years now, and I've seen its markets transform more and more rapidly (E-commerce, V-commerce, omnichannel distribution, multiplication of niche brands, "clean" active ingredients, etc.).
		</p>
		<p>
			In light of my readings, meetings and first internships, it seems to me that the current marketing concerns of the beauty market are of three levels:
			<br>
			‣ the customer experience especially in the context of the digital revolution and thus the adaptation to the Covid pandemic ;
			<br>
			‣ the impact of cosmetic products on both the environment and consumer health;
			<br>
			‣ the evolution of beauty criteria and standards, the "embrace your difference" mentality with genderlessness, the LGBTQ+ community, bodypositivism, ...

		<h2>
			Marketing.
		</h2>
		<p>
			I am also very interested in Marketing. 
			<br>
			I was able to discover the marketing and communication jobs when I chose to be part of the "<a href="https://www.entreprendre-pour-apprendre.fr/mini-entreprise/parcours-mini-l" target="_blank">mini-company</a>" project in my high school.
			<br>
			Following this experience, I chose to attend a business school to learn the profession and possibly end up specializing in marketing.
